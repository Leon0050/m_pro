# m_programming

This repository contains my personal programming practices and study projects.

I am a student from **Monash University**, and this repo is mainly used to organize and track my learning progress across different areas including software development, databases, AI relative and quantitative analysis.

## Notes
- This repository may contain unfinished code, drafts, or experimental implementations.
- Large datasets and generated files are intentionally not tracked.
- The structure may evolve as learning progresses.
